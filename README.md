## üöÄ„ÄÄOverview

- **Battery Driven, Compact, High-Accuracy GNSS Receiver:** Designed the compact (Approx. 48 mm x 48 mm x 22 mm) GNSS receiver to improve the usability of u-blox F9P, with Micro SD logger, communication and battery
- **Supports correction input via BLE:** By combining with the smartphone application such as `GNSS Master`, the receiver can utilize the correction data via `NTRIP`
- **Customizable microcontroller:** The microcontroller `Seeeduino XIAO` is utilized for the communication, so it‚Äôs easy to customize the application for user-dedicated objectives

**Important notes for use**
> [!WARNING]
> When you connect to the F9P usb port, you have to switch the hw switch `off`.
> The boards (`XIAO ESP32C`, `u-blox F9P` or both) will be damaged.

### Software

#### Python setup

To setup the python environment, use uv:

```bash
cd pocket-f9p
uv sync
```

#### XIAO ESP32C

##### Write Firmware

1. **Download Firmware:** Download firmware from: [MicroPython ESP32-C3](https://micropython.org/download/ESP32_GENERIC_C3/), and move it to this directory
2. **Erase Flash:** Erase the flash by `erase-flash` option
3. **Write Firmware:** Then, write the binary which is downloaded in step 1 by `write-flash` option.

###### Erase Flash

```bash
% esptool --port /dev/cu.usbmodem1101 erase-flash 
sptool v5.1.0

##### Write Script

After firmware writing, let's move on to the writing the application.

1. **Install Extension:** Install [MicroPico`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go) from MARKETPLACE
2. **Connect XIAO and Computer:** Connect XIAO and your computer with USB cable, then execute `Shift + >MicroPico: Connect` via `VS Code` command palette
3. **Write Script:** Open [main.py](src/pocket_f9p/main.py), then execute `Shift + >MicroPico: Upload file to pico` via command palette to upload the script to XIAO

#### u-blox F9P

The ports settings of F9P are as follows:

Target  |Protocol in            |Protocol out           |Baudrate   |Dest.
--------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-----
UART1   |0+1+5 - UBX+NMEA+RTCM3 |0+1+5 - UBX+NMEA+RTCM3 |115200     |Logger
UART2   |0+1+5 - UBX+NMEA+RTCM3 |**1 - NMEA**           |**38400**  |XIAO

> [!NOTE]
> - Our firmware supports **NMEA output only**
> - Set `1 - NMEA` for UART2 protocol out
>   - It is okay to set `0+1+5 - UBX+NMEA+RTCM3` for UART2 protocol out, however it's difficult to forward the whole data within 1 sec when using full GNSS constellations
> - We recommended the baudrate 38400bps, but the firmware can detect it automatically (supports 9600/38400/115200/57600/19200/230400 bps)

### üì± Setup (Smartphone, Android)

#### Application (GNSS Master)

We utilized [GNSS Master](https://www.gnssmaster.com/) for this development.

##### GNSS Receiver Connection Setting

Tap ‚öôÔ∏è on the right side of `GNSS Receiver Connection`, and set the following:

- **Mode:** `Bluetooth LE`
- **Paired Devices:** `Pocket-F9P`

##### Correction Input Setting

Tap ‚öôÔ∏è on the right side of `Correction Input`, and setting it if needed.

##### Receiver Data Output Setting

Tap ‚öôÔ∏è on the right side of `Receiver Data Output`, and setting it if needed.

#### Other settings (Developer Mode, etc.)

- **Enabling Developer mode:** see [Configure on-device developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options?hl=en)
- **Select mock location app:** see [Debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options?hl=en#debugging)

## üìñ How to use?

### Basic usage

1. **Power on the receiver:** 
    - Battery Driven: Switch `ON` the HW Switch
    - Using USB Bus Power: Connect the usb cable to the `XIAO`'s port, if you want to charge the battery, you should switch `ON` the HW switch as well
2. **Start GNSS Master and Connect to the receiver:** see [GNSS Receiver Connection Setting](#gnss-receiver-connection-setting)
3. **Connect the Correction Input (If needed):** see [Correction Input Setting](#correction-input-setting)

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome bug reports, feature suggestions and pull requests.

1.  Please create an issue to report the problem.
2.  When submitting the PR, clearly describe the changes made.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Limitations

- **Prototype Quality:** This HW and SW are prototype, therefore we have not performed sufficient verification
    - **XIAO Antenna Exposure:** The XIAO's BLE antenna and its cable are exposed on the outside of the case. This poses a risk to long-term robustness and potential snagging of the cable. (‚úÖ `v0.2.0`: Add exoskeleton frame)
- **Application Dependency:** We checked the application compatibility only with `GNSS Master`
- **NTRIP Correction:** We have not verified the NTRIP correction
- **Regarding GNSS Status view in GNSS Master:** We confirmed the following issues, but we do not verify the further details:
    - The UTC time does not update for several seconds
    - Sometimes `No NMEA RMC` is shown
